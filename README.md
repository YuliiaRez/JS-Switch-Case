# JS-Switch-Case
1) The num variable can take 4 values: 1, 2, 3 or 4. If it has the value '1', then we will write 'winter' into the result variable, if it has the value '2' - 'spring' and so on. Solve the problem through switch-case.
2) The month variable contains some number from the interval from 1 to 12. Determine what time of the year this month falls on (winter, summer, spring, autumn).
3) Ask the user for the number of the day of the week and display the corresponding full string name (for example, if the user enters 7, the message "Sunday" is displayed). provide input error (default)
4) The day variable contains some number from the interval from 1 to 31. Determine which decade of the month this number falls in (first, second or third).
